Code for the paper "Neuro-symbolic Learning Yielding Logical Constraints"

### Usage

To reproduce the experimental results, Run the command sh run.sh in each task folder. 

### Note
I am still processing the dataset of self-driving task involved in the paper, but I am too busy recently. I will upload the dataset and the code as soon as possible.
